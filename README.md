# Python Weather App

* This project uses an API Key from OpenWeatherMap
* The GUI was built using Tkinter
* Input a city and read the weather for that city along with more information about the city
  - such as country, sunrise, and sunset
 
* Make sure to replace the api_key in api_key.txt with your own api_key from [openweathermap.org/api](openweathermap.org/api)
